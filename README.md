# TwitterBruteForce
This is a Bruteforce way - to implement TWITTER CHALENGE by using Twitter4j, Here I used Twitter4J API to implement the functionalities of the given requirement

1. Read Tweets
2. 2.Search content in the Tweets
3. Display Tweets (USER NAME, USER SCREEN NAME, TWEET CONTENT, COUNT OF MESSAGE THAT WAS RETWEETED) 
4. OAUTHENTICATION 

Why choose Twitter4J to implement Bruteforce code:
1. Java library for the Twitter API.
2. Easily integrate Java application with the Twitter service, In twitter official developer site was mentioned about the Twitter4j API.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Working code:

1. TweetConstants.java -- declared all the constants and key info.. for easy to access the required paramenters
2. TweetAPI.java --- This class is the implementation of main functionalities in this requirement. Here I used the Twitter4J libraries to implement the functionlity.
3. TweetClient.java --- Client side implementation

Note: This is the brute force implentation that I done in plain java  - to make an easy understand about twitter API implementation.
