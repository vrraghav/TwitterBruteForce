# TwitterBruteForce
This is a Bruteforce way - to implement TWITTER CHALENGE by using Twitter4j, Here I used Twitter4J API to implement the functionalities of the given requirement

1. Read Tweets
2. 2.Search content in the Tweets
3. Display Tweets (USER NAME, USER SCREEN NAME, TWEET CONTENT, COUNT OF MESSAGE THAT WAS RETWEETED) 
4. OAUTHENTICATION 

Why choose Twitter4J to implement Bruteforce code:
1. Java library for the Twitter API.
2. Easily integrate Java application with the Twitter service, In twitter official developer site was mentioned about the Twitter4j API.
